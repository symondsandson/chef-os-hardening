# here we try to determine which components should be included.
# You can control the behaviour via setting the node['os-hardening']['components'][recipe_name]
# to true (to include it) or to false (to skip it) on the override level, e.g.
#
# override['os-hardening']['components']['sysctl'] = false
#

# generic components, include them per default
